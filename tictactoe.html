/*

Tic-Tac-Toe game in javascript using RaphaÃ«l, and Underscore.js.

The game board is represented by a one-dimensional array where the elements
map to board locations like so:

0|1|2
-----
3|4|5
-----
6|7|8

A value of 0 for a position means the square is blank, 1 is player 1 (X, the
user), 2 is player 2 (O, the computer).

Because tic-tac-toe is so simple, we can just pre-compute the optimal moves
for each possible tic-tac-toe game state. There are 3**9 or about 20k possible
game states, most of which would not be reached because someone would win
before that state was achieved.  Then, given a game board, we can just look up
where the computer should place an O.

All the actual work happens inside of the ActionTable.prototype.populate
function. This function takes about 300 ms (in Chrome) to run on my computer
with a blank board. This table could be pre-computed or only calculated after
the first move to make it faster.
